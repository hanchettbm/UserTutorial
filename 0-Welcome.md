# WELCOME

Welcome to This Python tutorial Page! Here will be a tutorial for some of the most important python data structures as well as examples, and trial problems for you to solve. We will cover many topics that can be somewhat advanced, but will be broken  down simply enough that anyone with basic python understanding can understand them no problem! Take some time to learn and then share with others your ideas, we strongly encourage you to make up your own test problems. Let's dive right in!
